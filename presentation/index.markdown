The Presentation
================

If you want a quick introduction to Caty, but you want something
different -- not the normal boring tutorials, examples etc. -- then
this is the place for you!
The presentation is a small PowerPoint-like presentation about what
Caty is and the ideas behind it.
It comes as a PDF file with 41 slides and should take about 10
minutes to enjoy ;-)
So go ahead, take the time and
[grab the slideware while it's still hot] [presentation].
