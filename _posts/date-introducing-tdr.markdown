# [Todo Done Right] [tdr] #

Yep. That's the title. Very humble. But it's good...

It's a Ruby todo manager -- as the title suggests -- for the UNIX console.
It handles items with text, an index and a priority and can be
operated with your favorite console edior.

It also features input via the command line, STDIN and files, which
makes it machine operable. Also the todo files are simply YAML files,
so you can easily edit them with Ruby scripts.

It can use colors for output and has a simple config file to store your
settings.

Furthermore it can store global aliases for your todo files, making them
accessible from anywhere on your system.

Try it!
